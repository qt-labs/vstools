-------
- Fixed startup of Qt Designer and Qt Linguist when the application was
  not build for the current project's Qt Version. The Add-In tries to find
  the needed tool inside the directory of the other registered Qt Versions.
- "Generate basic pro file" gets disabled in project's context menu and Qt
  menu if the current project is a qmake generated project.
- When importing a solution file while a solution is opened, the user gets
  the possibility to automatically close the current solution.
- Avoid infinite recursion in inclusion which happened when moccing .cpp
  files, which used precompiled headers.
- Translation files are added when exporting project to a .pri file.

  the project is built the first time, the generated files are collapsed
  after the build has finished (QTBUG-4750).

  longer make the build fail (QTBUG-4756)

- Adding a Qt class no longer implies that precompiled headers are used.

(QTBUG-4783).

The Qt Visual Studio Add-In version 1.1.0 contains multiple bugfixes and
improvements.

  every configuration. This solves the problem of heavy changes in the vcproj
  file whenever the user switches to another build configuration. (Task 251918)
- Qt Designer, Qt Linguist and the QRC Editor are started via a properly
  registered editor wrapper. Now its possible to open ui files in other
  editors, like the built-in XML editor. (Task 250601)

  projects and back. (Task 153484)

  Windows CE projects. (Task 260550)
